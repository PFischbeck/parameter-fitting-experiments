These are the experiments for the paper "Robust Parameter Fitting to Realistic Network Models via Iterative Stochastic Approximation".

# Installation

- Make sure you have Python, Pip and R installed.
- Checkout this repository
- Install the python dependencies with

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Install the `pygirgs` package at https://github.com/PFischbeck/pygirgs

- Install the R dependencies (used for plots) with

```
R -e 'install.packages(c("ggplot2", "reshape2", "plyr", "dplyr", "scales"), repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'
```

- Download the file `konect-data.zip` from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10629451) and extract its contents into the folder `input_data/konect`
- Optional: Download the file `output-data.zip` from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10629451) and extract its contents into the folder `output_data`. This way, you can access all experiment results without running them yourself.

# File structure

- The folder `input_data` contains all networks used (KONECT) and generated (by random network models).
- The folder `output_data` contains all data and figures generated by the experiments.
- The files `experiments-*.py` are used for executing the Python experiments.
- The folder `R` contains R scripts for generating the plots.
- The folder `plots` contains all plots generated by the R scripts.

# Executing the experiments

- Execute `python3 experiments-models.py <experiment_name>` to run experiments related to the models. The different experiments are as follows:
  - For some `<model>` in `"erdos-renyi", "chung-lu-pl", "girg-1d"`, run:
    - `sample_and_measure_<model>` to sample from the model and measure the resulting feature values
    - `fit_parameters_<model>` to fit the parameters via the ParFit algorithm
    - `fitted_sample_and_measure_<model>` to sample and measure features based on the fitted parameters
  - `merge_csv` to merge all files for further processing in R
- Execute `python3 experiments-konect.py <experiment_name>` to run experiments related to the real-world networks. The different experiments are as follows:
  - `clean_graphs` to convert each real-world network to its largest component and convert the format
  - `measure_target_features` to measure the target features for every real-world network
  - For some `<model>` in `"erdos-renyi", "chung-lu-pl", "girg-1d"`, run:
    - `fit_parameters_<model>` to fit the parameters via the ParFit algorithm
    - `fitted_sample_and_measure_<model>` to sample and measure features based on the fitted parameters
  - `merge_csv` to merge all files for further processing in R
- Execute `python3 experiments-ablation.py <experiment_name>` to run experiments related to the ParFit configuration (i.e., alpha and threshold values). The different experiments are as follows:
  - For some `<model>` in `"erdos-renyi", "chung-lu-pl", "girg-1d"`, run:
    - `fit_parameters_alpha_<model>` to fit the parameters via the ParFit algorithm (for alpha experiments)
    - `fit_parameters_threshold_<model>` to fit the parameters via the ParFit algorithm (for treshold experiments)
    - `fitted_sample_and_measure_alpha_<model>` to sample and measure features based on the fitted parameters (for alpha experiments)
    - `fitted_sample_and_measure_threshold_<model>` to sample and measure features based on the fitted parameters (for threshold experiments)
  - `merge_csv` to merge all files for further processing in R

# Running R scripts

Run `Rscript R/<scriptname>` to run R scripts, found in the `R`subfolder. For example, run `Rscript R/erdos-renyi-ablation-alpha.R` to generate figures and tables related to the effect of the alpha configuration of ParFit for the ER model. The resulting figures and tables can be found in `output_data/figures`.
